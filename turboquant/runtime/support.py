"""
turboquant.runtime.support — central model-family support gate.

This module is the EXPLICIT AND ONLY source of truth for which model families have
TurboQuant attention wiring and runtime-certification coverage. All documentation,
release notes, and test assertions MUST match this file exactly.

Callers
-------
- ``integrations.mlx.upgrade.upgrade_cache_list`` — Gate 2 check
- ``tests/unit_static/test_governance.py``          — static contract tests

Rules for adding a new family
------------------------------
1. Wire its attention module to dispatch through TurboQuant's streaming
   attention path (see ``mlx_lm/models/gemma.py`` for the reference pattern).
2. Add runtime-certification coverage in
   ``scripts/certify_apple_runtime.sh`` / ``benchmarks/runtime_cert/``.
3. Add the normalised family name to :data:`SUPPORTED_FAMILIES`.
4. Update ``docs/support_matrix.md``.

Do NOT add a family here before completing steps 1–3.
